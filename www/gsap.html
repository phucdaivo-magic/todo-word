            British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the United Kingdom’s nuclear deterrent requires it to have good
            relations with the United States.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It is in our national interest that we continue to work with the Americans when it comes to defense,
            security
            and to intelligence,” Starmer said Monday, fielding questions from reporters about whether US President
            Donald
            Trump’s threats to acquire Greenland might cause a fundamental rupture in relations between the US and the
            UK,
            along with other NATO allies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The prime minister said the UK’s nuclear deterrent “is our foremost weapon… when it comes to securing the
            safety
            of everybody in the United Kingdom, (which is) my primary duty.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “That requires us to have a good relationship with the United States,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean… that
            we
            pretend we don’t have differences.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The prime minister stressed that it is not right for the UK to “choose between the US and Europe,” because
            it
            remains allies of both.
