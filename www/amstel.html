                    <p class="ams-brand-story__description">
                        As it happens, Amstel Beer was born from the very particular friendship of its two founders:
                        Charles de Pesters and Johannes van Marwijk Kooy. Brothers-In-Law and best friends who, as the
                        story goes, could not find a single beer in Amsterdam that they both liked. So they decided to
                        create their own. The rest is history.
